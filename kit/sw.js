/* Offline support for the workshop kit page.

   Venue bandwidth for 15 to 30 laptops at once is the biggest unknown of
   the night, so once this page has loaded it must keep working with the
   connection gone: a reload, a reopened laptop, or a dropped wifi should
   never cost an attendee their work.

   This worker only ever touches this page and its own assets. It stores
   nothing an attendee types. Their answers live in localStorage, which a
   service worker cannot read, and nothing typed is ever put in a URL, so
   nothing typed can end up in this cache.

   THREE THINGS THIS FILE IS CAREFUL ABOUT

   1. The slides PDF is NOT precached. It is 950KB against a 132KB page.
      Precaching it meant every laptop in the room pulled roughly 1.1MB in
      the same sixty seconds the QR went up on screen, for a file most
      people open later at home. It is now cached only once someone
      actually downloads it, which is also when they are most likely to
      want it available offline.

   2. Network first, but on a CLOCK. A dead connection rejects fast and
      falls back to cache. Bad conference wifi does something worse: it
      accepts the socket and then stalls, so fetch() neither resolves nor
      rejects and the page hangs. If the network has not answered within
      NET_TIMEOUT and we hold a cached copy, we serve the cache at once
      and let the real response land in the background for next time.

   3. The update path. skipWaiting plus clients.claim plus network-first
      means a fix pushed on the day reaches a laptop that already loaded
      the page, on its next load, without anyone clearing anything. Bump
      CACHE on every deploy so the activate handler drops the old one. */

/* Bumped v2 -> v3 on 2026-07-28 after the deck copy was corrected. deck.html
   is not in ASSETS, but any attendee who opened it before the fix has the old
   one sitting in this runtime cache, and on venue wifi the NET_TIMEOUT branch
   below would serve exactly that. Renaming the cache makes the activate
   handler drop the whole thing, so no laptop can still be holding a deck that
   tells people to make a new project for every tool.

   v3 -> v4 on 2026-07-29: slide 1 now carries the real wifi network instead of
   two blank write-in rules. Same reasoning -- a laptop still holding the v3
   deck would show the room a blank line where Bruin-WIFI should be. NOTE this
   file came back from the presenter branch still reading v2, which would have
   silently undone yesterday's bump; v4 is deliberately past v3 so the merge
   moves the cache forward rather than backwards.

   v5 -> v6 on 2026-07-30, the morning of. /kit without a trailing slash used to
   be served in place, which left the document base at /kit and sent every
   relative link on the page to the site root. A laptop that opened that form
   has the broken-base page sitting in this runtime cache under the /kit key,
   and the NET_TIMEOUT branch below will hand it straight back on venue wifi
   even though the redirect is now live. Renaming the cache makes the activate
   handler drop the whole thing, so nobody in the room can still be holding it. */
